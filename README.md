# T Shirt Database

This is a project I am doing to practice using SQL, HTML, and PHP. I will be creating a local site where I can keep track of the shirts I have traded for, shirts I want, and shirts I am trading for.

The site doesn't actually work online since it is connect a local SQL database but I thought I would put it on the web anyways since I will doing some CSS and HTML work on it.
